My name is Feiyang Frank Yu. I am from MAPSS program, majored in political science and sociology. I am from the southern part of China. I have try to learn Python by myself two years ago, and this is the first time I learn something about R. It seems to me that the use of R is like using the functions in Python. It is efficient for data scientists, which is very helpful to me as well.
